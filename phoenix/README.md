# Phoenix

Continous Integration and Playlist automation for Spotify

## Goal

Goal of this project is to automate the process of playlist management based on rules, actions and triggers like a CI does for software.

For example imagine a user that puts every track he likes into a single playlist. Over the time he puts over 10.000 tracks into this playlist and one day he decides to split it up on multiple playlists. The manual selection of tracks and moving them into a new playlist would be a cumbersome process. This is one usage example where Phoenix comes into play. It is capable of selecting tracks based on track metrics and defined rules and performes actions on them like moving.

Another example would be a user that has a fixed workflow for managing and sorting tracks into his playlist collection. He stores every track that he likes into a playlist called "Quality Assurance", once in a month he goes through this playlist, removes tracks he had skipped always and adds tracks he actively listens to into a genre specific playlist. Phoenix could automate the process by keeping track about the users playback and triggers on specific theresholds like _played 5 times in a week_ an action which inserts this track into a suitable playlist.
